--If the files are not being ignored even after adding the patterns to your .gitignore file,

REMOVING FROM THE STAGING..
 NOTE BY DEFAULT IN VISUAL STUDIO ALL FILES ARE IN THE STAGED LOCATION (BZ HERE we are not adding by git . --->  by Default these are Adding... like git . add then finally we  we have to select the files from the staging to commit so
 means we are selecting only those files which we need to commit from the staged enviroment)

In this case, you need to untrack them and remove them from the repository. You can do this by running the following commands for each file or directory:
git rm --cached -r .vs/Axionic/v16/.suo
git rm --cached -r "**/obj/"

Sometimes, Git might have cached information about the files. You can clear the cache by running:
git rm -r --cached .
git add .
